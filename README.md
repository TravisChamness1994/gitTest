***By Robert Trujillo, Alexander Sullivan, Arthur Hui and Travis Chamness***

"GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere." - guides.github.com

Learning to use github is a skill that is useful professionally and personally. This small tutorial will go over the basics of how to use github.

***Where to starts?*** Begin by setting up an account here at github.com. The account is free, and if you are using this professionally be sure to use a good username. GitHubs can act as a boost to your resume so take advantage of this if it fits your needs. The topics covered here will be primarily based on using the terminal to navigate github. 

***Installing Git:***

For Linux Debian - In terminal enter ```sudo apt-get install git```

For Linux Fedora - In terminal enter ```sudo yum install git```


***Lets begin setting up your first repository!*** To start a repository, go to your profile and click the repositories section. Once there, click the New button to create a new repository. Follow the "Create a Repository" section of this guide for a good graphical example and instructions. https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/. You can name your repository anything you would like, but hello world is a good place to start practicing!
